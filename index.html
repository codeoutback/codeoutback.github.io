<!--Hello and welcome to my website! This has been a work in progress and I finally have made quite a bit of progress over
this past 3 day weekend 2/21/23. I love coding and messing around with it to see what I can make. I hope you enjoy this site 
as much as I have had creating it. I would love to hear feedback as well about the code/ design and how I could make this better. 
My goal eventually is to make it I think so the drop downs do not go to any more external links or pages but instead will use an 
array or a for loop to go through the items in the drop down and based on the item clicked, that information will show on the page. 
I left comments on all the pages but definitely this page as well as the edu_button.js I focused on. I would say that coding wise I 
am comfortable with if statements, for loops, while loops and do while loops. I have worked with linked lists before but not really 
with Javascript. I have also tried to touch on maps (I know they have key/ value pairs). I have also read about trees before. I would 
say that anything past arrays I need studying on/ refreshers. Thank you so much!-->
